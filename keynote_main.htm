  <h4>Abstract</h4>
The rapid development in smart sensor technologies has major impact across most industries, with rich information
collected to assist information management and decision making. Among these, visual sensors acquire rich media data
from natural and built environments, which plays crucial role in smart Internet of Things. While visual sensors promise
improved services in manufacturing, health, surveillance, monitoring, and vehicular industries, techniques in acquisition,
processing, and analysis remain on-going challenges. This keynote address will cover the evolution of visual sensor
development in the recent past, and showcase various applications facilitated by visual sensors. Present challenges of
visual sensor applications will be presented, and future research directions will be discussed.

<h4>Biography</h4>
Ivan Lee received the B.Eng., M.Com., MER, and Ph.D. degrees from The University of Sydney. He was a software
development engineer at Cisco Systems, a software engineer at Remotek Corporation, and an Assistant Professor at
