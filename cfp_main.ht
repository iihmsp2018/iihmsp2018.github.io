  <hr>
		<p>The Fourteenth International Conference on Intelligent Information 
		Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP 2018), is technically 
		co-sponsored by Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku 
		University in Japan, Fujian University of Technology in China, and 
		Taiwan Association for Web Intelligence Consortium.</p>
		<p>Multimedia technologies facilitate the creation of global information 
		infrastructure for acquiring, storing, communicating data with different 
		forms. Proliferation of multimedia applications raises challenges such 
		as multimedia security and privacy, big data in multimedia, and 
		intelligence in multimedia processing. IIH-MSP is an annual event 
		serving as an international forum for researchers and practitioners from 
		information hiding and multimedia signal processing to exchange latest 
		research outcomes. We invite submissions of original research papers for 
		the conference tracks: (1) Information Hiding and Security, (2) 
		Multimedia Signal Processing and Networking, and (3) BioÅ]inspired 
		Multimedia Technologies and Systems.</p>
